        <h2>Brief Summary of Each Movie</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>
        
        Star Wars Episode I, the Phantom Menace: </h3>
<p>
        Obi-Wan Kenobi is a young Jedi knight under the training of Qui-Gon Jinn, his master. Anakin Skywalker, who will later give birth to Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader, is currently a 9-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation closes all paths to the planet Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are sent to conclude the issue. </p>

        <h3>
       
        Star Wars Episode II, the Attack of the Clones</h3>
        <p>
        Ten years after the crisis of the Phantom Menace the Republic continues to be surrounded with chaos. A movement involving hundreds of planets and huge alliances creates new threats to the galaxy that even the Republic and the Jedis cannot maintain. This movement, long planned by an unrevealed force, resulted in the beginning of the Clone Wars, and the start of a massive threat to the Republic. </p>

        <h3>
       
        Star Wars Episode III, the Revenge of the Sith</h3>
        <p>
        Three years after the start of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker work together to save Chancellor Palpatine from Grievous, the leader of the droid army, but Grievous escapes immediately afterwards. Accusations are created within the Jedi Council involving Chancellor Palpatine, to which Anakin has befriended. After Anakin is asked to spy on the chancellor, and full of hatred toward the Jedi Council, Anakin joins the Dark Side. </p>

          <h2>Weapons Used in Star Wars</h2>
          <p>Star Wars is a science fiction franchise, so the weapons are obviously futuristic. Jedi Knights and Siths use lightsabers, which are swords with a laser blade. The lightsaber is the most powerful hand-held weapon in Star Wars, that only Jedi's and Siths know how to use. But, on the Republic side and the Imperial Forces side, there are armies of weaker soldiers. The Republic has an army of Clone Troopers. These men use blue laser blasters. The Imperial Forces have an army of droids (robots) that use red laser blasters. Lightsabers can deflect lasers launched from the blasters, which make them the most powerful and terrifying hand-held weapon in the series. </p>

          <h2>What Are Lightsabers?</h2>
          <p>In the movies, lightsabers are created with crystals found in the planet Ilum. These crystals are used to power the lightsabers. The energy from the crystal is shot through the lightsaber focusing energy channel, which creates the laser blade. This energy channel is opened with the push of a button, which activates the laser blade.</p>
